Oops!  I don't think that was intended, but you seem to have stepped into a
hole! You are in a state where your "HEAD detached".  It's not a good look,
I know...

Let's try get you back to your adventure, shall we? If you just landed in this
pickle, you may be able to just checkout the previous revision.  Try to
execute the following:

    $ git checkout -

OK, that didn't work?  Let's look for the location you were last at.  Execute
the following:

    $ git branch

and look for a familiar level.  Once you have found it, go back there by
executing the following command:

    $ git checkout <name of level>

Good luck!  Hope you attach those body parts...
