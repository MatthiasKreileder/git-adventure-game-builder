You slowly awake. 

As you open your eyes, you find you are lying on your back looking up into a starry sky.

You get up and you are surrounded by trees that stretch far far above you. You are 
standing in a clearing and in the middle of the clearing you see a monolith that 
reaches just above your head. 

Etched deeply into the stone are these words:



    Welcome traveller from a far land.
    Welcome to the forest.
    Beware, for this is a place of ghosts and dark magic,
    and the places that you visit will seek to trap you.

    Around you is darkness.
    You must use magic to see the way forward.
    The creatures of this place may help you, 
    but only if you help them.
    
    Otherwise you must make your own magic.
    You must MAKE A TALISMAN.
    Use my name for the first talisman.
    My name is grace.



Something flutters by your feet. You see a folded piece of parchment on the ground, with strange
symbols scrawled on it. As you stare at it you realise this is the talisman the engraving 
speaks of. You unfold the paper and look inside, it's blank. 

The talisman doesn't seem to be working...
