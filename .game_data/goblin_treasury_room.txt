You have reached the goblin mines ... The goblins descend into the mines each
day to search for diamonds.  Once their work for the day is done they come back
and place them into the treasury.

The treasurer looks after the treasury and makes sure that all diamonds are
saved and no one can steal them.  Only his goblin workforce has access to the
treasury in order to place the diamonds in there.

At certain points in the year the treasurer inspects the treasury thoroughly to
count the number of diamonds.  One day she realizes that some diamonds are
missing.  Could it be that a goblin took some of them?

Can you help the treasurer to find out what happened?
