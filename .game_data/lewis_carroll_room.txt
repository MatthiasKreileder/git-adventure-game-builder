You reach the house of the miserable poet.  As always he sits in front of his
house and looks very sad.

You would like to help him.  So you ask him about his story.

He wrote a poem once.  The best he’s ever written.  He worked on it for months
and each time he needed some rest he placed it on the windowsill. Every other
week a new idea came to his mind and he adds another verse to the poem.

Over time he gets more and more engaged with other projects he’s working
on .. forgetting about the poem on his windowsill.

Then … many months later … he remembers that he wrote such a good poem and he
runs to the windowsill to get it.  Once he looks at the poem he is shocked.  
Then sun made the ink fade away - making the poem unreadable.

Only a true git wizard like you can recover the document as it looked like in 
the past.
