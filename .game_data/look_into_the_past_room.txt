You have arrived in a grassy clearing. 
In the middle of the clearing, sitting on a tuffet of grass is an extremely ugly gnome.
Its eyes are crossed and unfocussed, it turns its head in your direction and murmurs:

	Finding my name is as hard as finding a fish

The gnome turn away and sits giggling to itself.
