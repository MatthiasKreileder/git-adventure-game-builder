Mystical creatures live in the git adventure forest.  You want to keep memories
of this magical place - so you aim to take snapshots fotos of the wild animals 
that you encounter in the filesystem tree.

You are equipped with a camera. You can take picture by `git add <animal>`
followed by a `git commit` sequence of commands.

Let's say you see a phoenix high up in the mountains

$ ls mountains/
$ phoenix

Let's look at this creature

$ cat mountains/phoenix
      _,     ,_
    .'/  ,_   \'.
   |  \__( >__/  |
   \             /
    '-..__ __..-'
jgs      /_\

You can check if you already have a snapshot of this animal by running

$ git status
Untracked files:
    ...
    mountains/phoenix

The phoenix is untracked, so we want to take a picute of it.

$ git add mountains/phoenix
$ git commit -m "Great phoenix snapshot foto!"

...

Now, it's up to you to find the next animal.  Can you have a look around if 
you can see a unicorn?
