Ah, weary traveler.  If you so wish, you may skip this level and attempt it at
a later time.  There are some alternatives I might suggest if you have not
tried them yet...

  o The 'hint' command might just prove useful in circumstances such as these.

  o There is also a useful scroll: 'HELP.md' which contains snippets of wisdom.

Ensure that you have thoughtfully considered your decision before you wonder
off though.  You do not want to be caught out unprepared...
