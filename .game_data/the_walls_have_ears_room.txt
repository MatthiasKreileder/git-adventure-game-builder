You enter a clearing
At the edge of the clearing two walls have been built, a brick wall to the left and a flint wall to the right
Between them is an archway. When you peer through the archway you can see nothing but darkness into which it would be dangerous to venture without magic.

Scrawled on the left wall are the words:
	You can use my name to make a talisman against the darkness
	But only if you can find out what it is

Chiseled on the right wall are the words:
	Sorry, my name is a secret
	I've only told the walls :-P
