Remember that you are equipped with a tool that allows you look into the past
and find all references to an artifact. This magic tool can be invoked via 
`git log --oneline --all --graph  -- shard.txt` to give you all places in the
past where the shared occurred.

You can take a closer look at what you found by 
`git show <ref_name>~<integer>:shard.txt`
