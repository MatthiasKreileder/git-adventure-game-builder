As you walk deeper and deeper into the forest you realize that the pathway
becomes muddy and watery.  You reach a clearing and find yourself in front
of a wetland, a swamp.

You see a will-o-the-wisp, not too far from you.  It whispers:

    Welcome brave traveler...

    This place was once home to a long forgotten civilization.

    Not far from where you are standing now,
    stood once a temple.

    A place to worship a god whose name hasn't been
    spelled in eons.

The voice turns silent and the will-o-the-wisp disappears.

Near the place where the voice came from lies a shimmering stone at the bottom
of the shallow waters.

You reach out with your hand and pick it up.  It seems to have letters engraved
on it but you can't read them. Somewhere here in the swamp must be the missing
pieces of this artifact.

Can you find any locations where other pieces of the artifact might be buried?
